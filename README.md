## Status

Project is _work in progress_.

That means it is _NOT_ finished and I am working on it.

I am open to any suggestions about it so if you want you can create an issue to it or contact me :)

## Why did I create it

I love play games and I always wanted to create one (or more). My first idea was to make a rpg game but it didn't go well. At the same time I started to play [Risk of Rain 2](https://www.riskofrain.com/). I suspended old project and started new one similar to Risk of Rain (first part) and here it is Architect's Dream!
